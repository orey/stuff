# CPU limit

In 2025, my laptop showed a problem while using `opera` and all other browsers. At some point, a page is taking 100% CPU and blocks the OS.

This script prevents this to happen.

It is not packaged but it works (I tried other system solutions but could not make them work, considering the time that I had to find a solution).
