## A converter based on the default puthon HTML parser

I tried several converters but could not get a staisfactory conversion of tables. This converter supposes you copy the table as image and gerenates a log file with the required image list.

TODO: get the list of files out of the script.

## Version

The original version is in the srd-3.5 repo.
